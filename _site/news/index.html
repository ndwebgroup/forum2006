	<p>September 14, 2006 Joyce Center arena</p>


	<p>&#8220;The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political, economic or social condition.&#8221;</p>


	<p>These words, from the Constitution of the World Health Organization, were written more than half a century ago; yet today, a greater number and even greater percentage of the world’s population live in communities where poverty, disease, and premature death are the norm. Despite incredible scientific achievements, preventable or treatable diseases continue to devastate large segments of the human community—including 10 million children who die each year.</p>


	<p>What responsibility do we have to reach out to those who suffer from poverty, malnutrition, and disease? Moreover, given increased global interconnectivity, can we ignore this global health crisis without risking new threats from infectious diseases?</p>


	<p>The second annual Notre Dame Forum engages these important questions by inviting discussion across the various fields of inquiry that relate to global health concerns. Experts from the field will convene with members of the Notre Dame community to seriously reflect on appropriate responses to the pressing global health crisis.</p></div>
