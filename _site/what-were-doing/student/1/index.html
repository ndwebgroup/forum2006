		<p>Michael Kozak traveled to Uganda.</p>
	</div>

	<div><p>Mike returned to the United States this July after nine weeks experiencing health, education, and faith life in Uganda as the guest of a parish run by the Congregation of Holy Cross. His journey was coordinated through the International Summer Service Learning Program in Notre Dame’s Center for Social Concerns.</p>


	<p>While staying at a Holy Cross parish, Mike helped to teach science courses in a local secondary school, getting a first-hand look at how Ugandan students were preparing for the study of medicine. Among the challenges he saw: Many of the students who become doctors leave Uganda to practice their skills elsewhere; modern treatment equipment is not commonplace; and the lack of diversity in the Ugandan diet makes people more prone to illness. He was present as one of the parish priests started an <span class="caps">AIDS</span> ministry in the community to spread awareness and testing.</p>


	<p>Mike says he gained an understanding of international health issues that one can’t get “until you actually see the dynamics” in another country. He wants to become a physician and to participate in a poverty health program that allows American doctors to rotate in and out of impoverished countries while maintaining primary contact with their family and practice in the US.</p></div>
