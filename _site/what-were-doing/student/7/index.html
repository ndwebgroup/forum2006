		<p>Kim Del Guercio traveled to Malawi.</p>
	</div>

	<div><p>Kim spent two months this summer in Malawi, one of the poorest nations in the world, seeing first-hand the linkage between malnourishment and vulnerability to diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, and <span class="caps">HIV</span>/AIDS. Through the Center for Social Concerns and its International Summer Service Learning Program, Kim connected with Catholic Relief Services, which placed her first with a program that focuses on feeding families at risk of starvation and then with a community care center for orphans.</p>


	<p>Many of those orphaned had lost one or both parents to <span class="caps">HIV</span>/AIDS, which is especially ravaging to the malnourished, Kim says. Her experiences, which included on-site service to the <span class="caps">CRS</span> clients as well as communication and database assistance to  boost organizations’ efficacy and influence, increased her interest in pursuing a master’s degree in public health and eventually working in international relief and development.</p>


	<p>“I like to think of myself as a world citizen,” explains Kim. Her own roots are Korean, but she was adopted by American parents; two summers ago, she worked with a social welfare services agency in South Korea, and on her flight back to America she volunteered to accompany a child who was also being adopted in the U.S. The idea of human caring that literally spans cultures and continents “makes me want to give back.”</p></div>
