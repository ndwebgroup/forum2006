		<p>Anne-Marie Rick traveled to Calcutta.</p>
	</div>

	<div><p>Anne-Marie joined in the apostolates of Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity when she traveled to Calcutta this past summer. Through the Center for Social Concerns’ service learning program, she worked in a hospice for the destitute, as well as in an orphanage—places where the cruel hand of neglect, malnourishment, and inadequate health care systems could be seen taking a huge toll.</p>


	<p>The experiences opened her eyes to severe dangers that destitute populations around the world face from infections that Americans would be able to treat when they were still small problems, she says.</p>


	<p>Drawing from experiences including Calcutta and an earlier Notre Dame study program in Shanghai, China, Anne-Marie says her career thoughts have been gravitating toward the field of international public health—a change from her earlier determination to become a veterinarian. After her exposure to profound human and humanitarian concerns, she is interested in such policy areas as the health implications for Mexican immigrants in the United States. She says she may go to work for a non-governmental organization after graduation or go on to study public health.</p></div>
