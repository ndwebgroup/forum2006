				<h1>Work in the Field</h1>

<p>You can help through Notre Dame’s many opportunities to get involved. Check out internships, courses, and programs from our departments, institutes, and centers: </p>

<h2><a href="http://socialconcerns.nd.edu">Center for Social Concerns</a></h2>
<p>The Center for Social Concerns creates formative educational and service experiences, calling us all to action for a more just and humane world.</p>

<p>Please be aware that certain sites may be cancelled and other sites added at any point during the selection and orientation process. If you'd like to see what other students have done, there are public files with description sheets, past participants' papers, pictures, and more information on the organization  available for your review. These "ISSLP Site Files" can be found in the file cabinets outside the Student Workroom in the Lounge of the Center for Social Concerns.</p>

<h2><a href="http://socialconcerns.nd.edu/academic/summer/ISSLP.shtml">International Summer Service Learning Program: 2007</a></h2>
<p>The objective in this program is to challenge students who have had domestic service-learning experiences to encounter international realities and to provide them the opportunity to work with and learn from the poor and marginalized in international settings.</p>

<h2><a href="http://socialconcerns.nd.edu/academic/spring/ilades.shtml">Approaches to Poverty and Development: Santiago, Chile, Spring 2007</a></h2>

<h2><a href="http://socialconcerns.nd.edu/academic/coursesbyfaculty/econ_339.shtml">Addressing U.S. Poverty on the Local Level: Homelessness, Education, Health Care, Jobs</a></h2>
<p>After discussing definitions of poverty and related controversies, and taking a general look at who is poor in this country, this course will focus on four arenas where poverty manifests itself. Students will be asked throughout the course to consider ways they might use their skills to address some aspect of poverty now and in later life.</p>

<h2><a href="http://socialconcerns.nd.edu/academic/fall/rosebud.shtml">Global Health Initiative Seminar</a></h2>
<p>The Center for Social Concerns, in collaboration with the Global Health Initiative, is offering a weeklong seminar in Kansas City, Kansas.  During the weeklong course, students will gain exposure and insight into the dual social concerns of medical care delivery and homelessness within the local population via two distinct environments – Shalom House and the Southwest Boulevard Family Health Care Center. This seminar will not run Fall 2006.</p>

<h2><a href="http://socialconcerns.nd.edu/academic/spring/children_poverty.shtml">Children & Poverty Seminar, March 9-17, 2007</a></h2>

The Seminar will focus in particular on education, early intervention, resilience, violence prevention, and foster care. Participants will begin their exploration during orientation sessions, where the current state of children in poverty will be examined, with insights from educators and youth advocates. </p>
