<div class="speaker">
	<h3 id="mdewan">Michael Dewan</h3>
	<img alt="Michael Dewan" class="image" src="/images/speakers/michael_dewan.jpg" />
	<p>Michael Dewan is a senior science preprofessional studies major, who has worked in Uganda through the International Summer Service Learning Program. Initially, Michael was to be a primary school teacher, but found himself spending half his time in an understaffed clinic. Through <a href="/what-were-doing/student/12">his experience working as a de facto lab technician</a>, he witnessed the ravages of HIV, malaria, Hepatitis, and TB, eventually contracting malaria himself. While he was able to afford the care and medicine (the equivalent of $8) to recover, he saw first-hand how most of the local population could not. Dewan later reflected in an essay on the contrast of his own outcome with the disease and the fact that malaria kills two Africans per minute, simply because they do not have access to the same level of treatment. Michael plans to start medical school next year and plans to keep international healthcare as a focus of his education.</p>

<div class="speaker">
	<h3>Ailis Tweed-Kent</h3>
	<img alt="Ailis Tweed-Kent" class="image" src="/images/speakers/ailis_tweed_kent.jpg" />
	<p>During the summer of 2005, Ailis Tweed-Kent, a senior majoring in chemical and biomolecular engineering with a minor in music, traveled to Mokhotlong, Lesotho in Southern Africa, to minister to the needs of children, many of them orphans, who have been affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in that country. Her work was sponsored by The Touching Tiny Lives Foundation, a non-governmental organization directed in Mokhotlong by Notre Dame graduate Ken Storen &rsquo;92. Upon her return, Tweed-Kent organized a series of fund raisers including a running race at her former high school that raised $10,000 for this cause. Ailis has also conducted research on osteoblasts, the bone cells responsible for producing calcium, in Notre Dame’s Tissue Culture Laboratory under the direction of Dr. Agnes Ostafin. </p>

<h2>Notre Dame Alumni Participants</h2>
<div class="speaker">
	<h3>Dr. David Gaus</h3>
	<img alt="Dr. David Gaus" class="image" src="/images/speakers/dgaus.jpg" />
	<p>Dr. David Gaus &rsquo;84, who graduated from Notre Dame with a BA in accountancy, is a physician and co-founder of Andean Health & Development, Inc., a non-profit agency created as a sustainable model of secondary health care delivery. The program currently addresses the health needs of more than 70, 000 residents throughout the poor tropical region of rural Ecuador. David&rsquo;s love for the Ecuadorian people began in 1984 when, freshly graduated, he went to Quito to serve as a volunteer in a boys&rsquo; home. That life-changing experience prompted him to pursue a degree in medicine with an eye toward returning to the slums of Quito to make a difference in the lives of the people who had befriended him. Eventually, he and two friends were able to found the clinic, which he hopes will help to create a healthcare system that will continue to serve the Ecuadorians long after he is gone. </p>

	<img alt="Keri Oxley" class="image" src="/images/speakers/koxley.jpg" />

She earned her undergraduate degree in philosophy with a supplemental major in preprofessional studies.

Her more notable endeavors include Hurricane Mitch relief efforts in Honduras, orphanage work in Thailand, and several visits to Mother Teresa&rsquo;s Home for the Dying in Kolkata.
