				<h1>Molly Kinder, '01 writes about <em>Millions Saved: Proven Successes in Global Health</em> </h1>

<p>A Notre Dame graduate working in the area of global health, Molly is currently a graduate student at Harvard University studying international development policy in a new program that Notre Dame Forum panelist Professor Jeffrey Sachs created.</p>

<p>Last year she worked with the World Bank on the earthquake in Pakistan and volunteered on health projects in a rural, tribal village in India. Previously, Molly worked at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>

<p>Molly wanted to share some of her recent work on global health and provide some information her book:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<em>Millions Saved</em> describes 17 very large-scale health programs in poor
countries that have saved millions of lived --- from the eradication of
smallpox, to the elimination of polio in Latin America, to the use of oral
rehydration therapy in Egypt to save children's lives from diarrheal disease
-- and demonstrates that the global community has the power to bring about
enormous improvements in health around the world.</p>

<p>The book is the best-selling book in the history of the center, is being used in dozens of classrooms across the country (and will be reprinted as a companion volume
for the first ever global health textbook), and has been praised widely in
the media and in policy circles.  Jeff Sachs has used it himself in his
work for the Millennium Development Goals.   (See quotes below from back of
book).</p>

<p>It is a great resource for undergraduates who want to learn more about global
health, and it sends a very inspiring message about the possibility for
real change.</p>

<p>At the center, we have also done some innovative projects to create
financial incentives for a malaria vaccines that is now being adopted by G8
countries and is the subject of a bill in Congress."</p></blockquote>

<h2>Quotes About Millions Saved:</h2>

<div class="sectioned"><blockquote><p>"This readable book challenges all those who would use the risk of failure
as an excuse to do little. It proves that commitment and compassion can
bring dramatic, large-scale improvements in the health of people around the
world."  --Jimmy Carter</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="sectioned"><blockquote><p>"The compelling experiences brought together in this book inspire us to take
a fresh look at what's needed to succeed in the future. Here is real-world
proof that major global health problems can be solved." --Bill Gates, Chairman, Microsoft Corporation</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="sectioned"><blockquote><p>"Notwithstanding the continuing tragedy of HIV and other diseases rampant in
the world today, there have been dramatic successes in improving health,
even in the poorest parts of the world. These successes - from polio
eradication in the Americas, to trachoma control in Morocco, to eradicating
smallpox - portend a hopeful future. This optimistic message makes this
book essential reading for all."  --K.Y. Amoako, Executive Secretary, Economic Commission on Africa</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="sectioned"><blockquote><p>"These well-documented case studies show that many successful public health
interventions have occurred, contrary to popular perception. The book
offers valuable lessons for dealing with the illnesses that continue to
beset the developing world."  --Kenneth Arrow, Professor of Economics (emeritus), Stanford University, 1972 Nobel Laureate in Economics</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="sectioned"><blockquote><p>"These accounts show why it is difficult, despite all of the problems, to
find fatalists and pessimists in the ranks of global health workers. Every
global health program can now aspire to be featured in the second volume of
this wonderful book."  --William Foege, Fellow, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="sectioned"><blockquote><p>"Today there are 40 million people suffering from HIV - three million are
children. Each year, two million people die of TB, one million die of
malaria, and 500,000 mothers die in pregnancy and childbirth. Every day
30,000 children die of illnesses that could have been treated or prevented.
This book shows that we can tackle this tremendous challenge. With more
money and better policies we can improve the health and life chances of the
world's poorest people."  --Gordon Brown, Chancellor of the Exchequer, United Kingdom</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="sectioned"><blockquote><p>"The stories told are powerful proof that it really pays to invest in health."
--Gro Harlem Brundtland, Former Director-General, World Health Organization</p></blockquote></div>
